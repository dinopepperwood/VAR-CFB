#How To Print (print Hello,World!)
#Create A Variable (int,string,float var: 3,hi,3.4!)
#Print a variable (print /var!)
#Add amount to variable (add var:4) Now Var will equal 7 since it was 3
#Subtract amount to variable (sub var:4) Now Var will equal -1 since it was 3
#Multiply amount to variable (mul var:4) Now Var will equal 12 since it was 3
#Divide amount to variable (div var:4) Now Var will equal 0.75 since it was 3
#That's Everything Good Luck
