#How To Print (print Hello,World!)
#Create A Variable (int,string,float var: 3,hi,3.4!)
#Print a variable (print /var!)
#Add amount to variable (add var:4) Now Var will equal 7 since it was 3
#Subtract amount to variable (sub var:4) Now Var will equal -1 since it was 3
#Multiply amount to variable (mul var:4) Now Var will equal 12 since it was 3
#Divide amount to variable (div var:4) Now Var will equal 0.75 since it was 3
#loop will loop a variable (loop var:3!) will print the value of a 3 times
#loopa,loops,loopm,loopd,loope will do a operating in order it goes add,subtract,multiply,division,exponentiation (loopa a:3:5) It will add a by 3 by 5 times just put different letters same syntax
#ifs four conditions(>,<,=,!=) (if var1 > var2: E!) if var1 is greater than var2 it will print E
#ifn1 and ifn2 are tricky a normal if can only compare variables but ifn1 compares the first number and compares the variable and ifn2 compares the variable to a second number (loopn1 3 > a: didje!) Could print didje
#ifa,ifs,ifm,ifd,ife compares two variables and does a operating depending on which if it goes in order add,subtract,multiplication,division,exponentiation syntax (ifa d > e: a:5!) would add a by 5
#loopp like the loop but will instead print a message that you pick (loopp a:Hello,World:3!) prints Hello,World 3 times
#That's Everything Good Luck
